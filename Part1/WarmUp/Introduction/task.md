Hello! You have already learned the very basic programming constructions. 
This lesson aims to help you learn a little more complex constructions, 
such as loops, conditional statements, and more.

----

The project of this lesson is **Bulls and cows (Mastermind)**.
This is a popular children's game of guessing the hidden word.
The detailed rules you can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows).

In this lesson, the project will be divided into two parts:
- First, you will create a game prototype that can play with the user 
but the hidden word will always be the same.
- The second step will be adding a randomly generated hidden word 
as well as the ability to safely communicate with the user: e.g., handle the user input.

The lesson includes the following topics:

- different types of variables;
- functions;
- loops;
- ranges;
- if expressions;
- `or` and `and` boolean operations;
- basic facts about the List collection, built-in functions to work with it, 
basic facts about lambda expressions in these built-in functions;
- random function.

Here's an example of the game:

In order for the picture to fit, additional line breaks were added.
You don't need to add them when solving the task.
