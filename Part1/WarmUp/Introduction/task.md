Hello! You have already learned with very basic constructions in programming. 
This lesson aims to help you learn a little more complex constructions, 
such as loops, conditional statements, and more.

----

The project of this lesson is **Bulls and cows (Mastermind)**.
This is a popular children's game by guessing the hidden word.
The detailed rules you can be read at the [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows).

In this lesson, the project will be divided into two parts:
- At the beginning, you will create a game prototype that can play with the user, 
but the hidden word will always be the same.
- The second step will be adding a randomly generated hidden word, 
as well as the ability to safely communicate with the user, e.g. handle the user input.

**TODO: add game gif??**

The lesson includes the following topics:

- different types of variables;
- functions;
- loops;
- ranges;
- if expressions;
- `or` and `and` boolean operations;
- basic knowledge about List collection, built-in functions to work with them, 
basic knowledge about lambda expressions in these built-in functions;
- random function.
