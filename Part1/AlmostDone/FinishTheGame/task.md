### Theory

Hooray! The project is almost finished, there is very little left! 
This time without new theoretical part!

### Task

**Description**: finish the game: implement the `photoshop` function: 
read picture and filter by using already implemented functions. 
Next, print the initial picture to the console, apply the filter and print new picture.
Finally, call this function into the `main` function.

Enjoy the project!

<div class="hint">
  You can expand this project yourself, for example, add new pre-defined pictures or filters.
