### Theory

Hooray! The project is almost finished, there is very little left! 
This time, without a new theoretical part!

### Task

**Description**: finish the game: implement the `photoshop` function: 
read the picture and the filter using already implemented functions. 
Next, print the initial picture to the console, apply the filter and print the new picture.
Finally, call this function into the `main` function.

Enjoy the project!
