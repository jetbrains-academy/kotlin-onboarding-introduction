The project of this lesson is **Console photoshop**.
The goal of this project is to create a simple Photoshop console app 
that can apply different filters to character images.

The lesson includes the following topics:

- multi-row strings;
- when expressions;
- basic handling of errors;
- string builder;
- null-safety (`!!` and `?:`).

An example of the final application:

![Console photoshop example](../../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/AlmostDone/game.gif "Console photoshop example")

In order for the picture to fit, additional line breaks were added.
You don't need to add them when solving the task.
