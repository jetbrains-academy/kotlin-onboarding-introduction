Hello! Welcome to the CSC Kotlin course. 
This block of the course is designed for beginners
and focuses on the basic concepts of the Kotlin language. 

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project, 
where, step by step, by completing different small tasks, 
you can get a finished small project.
At the end of each lesson, an additional similar project will be offered, 
including all the topics of the lesson, but it will not be divided into small tasks.

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html), 
which you can read later.
