Hello! Welcome to the Kotlin course. 
This course is designed for novices in Kotlin 
and focuses on the basic concepts of the Kotlin language. 

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project: 
step by step, by completing different small tasks, 
you will get a finished small project in the end.
At the end of each lesson, an additional similar project will be offered: 
it includes all the topics of the lesson but is not divided into small tasks.

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html), 
which you can read later.

Note, this course **does not provide the detailed explanation** of the basic concepts 
like variables, it only shows how to use the concepts in Kotlin and may remind you of their definitions.

Let's go!

### Project description

The project of this lesson is **Story twister**.
The goal of this game is to ask the user several fun questions,
remember the answers, and build a fun story from these answers. 
We will replace the real questions with new ones to make the final story ridiculous.

### Lesson topics

- the entry point for a Kotlin program;
- built-in functions for printing to console;
- variables;
- built-in functions for reading user input.
