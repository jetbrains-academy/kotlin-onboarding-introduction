In this task we will add variables to store user's answers.

### Task

Add empty `String` variables for the user answers with the names 
_firstUserAnswer_, _secondUserAnswer_, and _thirdUserAnswer_.

If you have any difficulties, **hints will help you solve this task**.

### Hints

<div class="hint" title="Push me to learn val or var keyword is better to use">

In the current task it is better to use the `val` keyword, since we will just _save_ values from the user 
into the variables and will not change them anymore.
