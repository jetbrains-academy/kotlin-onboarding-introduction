#### 1. What is a function?

When writing code, it is convenient to divide it into independent units â€“ 
[**functions**](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html), where each function performs a _specific_ action. 
For example, it prints something on the screen or evaluates the value of some expression.

We have already seen examples of functions in this course - for example, `main`, 
which we extended by new code, or _built-in_ functions such as `println` and `readlnOrNull`. 
Their peculiarity is that they perform a certain sequence of actions (_always the same_).
Each function, like `println`, can be called by its name.

#### 2. How to create a new function 

To create a function, you need to write the `fun` keyword and give it some name:
```kotlin
fun myName() {
    // Some code
}
```

#### 3. Function arguments

In addition, a function may have arguments. 
These arguments are available in the function's body. 
Arguments are declared in parentheses in the format `name: type`, 
and each of the arguments can have a default value, for example:
```kotlin
// By default intVariable has the default value 10
fun myName(intVariable: Int = 10, strVariable: String) {
    // The arguments are available in the function:
    println("$strVariable: $intVariable")
}
```

#### 4. The returned value

The function can also return a value.
For that, you should specify the type of the return value 
and return it using the `return` keyword:

```kotlin
fun myName(intVariable: Int, strVariable: String): Int {
    // The arguments are available in the function:
    println("$strVariable: $intVariable")
    return intVariable + 5
}
```

#### 5. Function as an expression

If a function can be expressed in [one statement](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html#single-expression-functions) (one action in the code), 
the `return` keyword, the type of the return value, and curly braces can be omitted. For example, consider the following code: 
```kotlin
fun myName(intVariable: Int): Int {
    return intVariable + 5
}
```
It is equivalent to:
```kotlin
fun myName(intVariable: Int) = intVariable + 5
```

#### 6. The `TODO` function

Kotlin has a special [`TODO()`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-t-o-d-o.html) function,  
which can be used as a temporary solution instead of implementing the function body:
```kotlin
fun myName(intVariable: Int): Int = TODO("Not implemented yet")
```

### Task

**Description**: add several functions to the game:

- _getGameRules_, which has three arguments: _wordLength_, _maxAttemptsCount_, and _secretExample_ and returns 
the text from the previous task about the game's rules
- _generateSecret_, which should return the hidden word. For the time being, let this function always return  `ABCD`
- _countPartialMatches_, which has two arguments (_secret_ and _guess_)
and returns the number of matched letters between them that are not in the same positions
- _countExactMatches_, which has two arguments (_secret_ and _guess_)
and returns the number of exact matched positions between them

Please use the `TODO` function where needed.
