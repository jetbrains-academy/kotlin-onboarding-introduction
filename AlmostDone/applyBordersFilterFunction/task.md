In this task we will add several _signatures_ of functions and implement one of them.

### Task

Add several functions to the game:

- _applyBordersFilter_, which has one string argument `picture`
  and returns a new picture with applied filter.
  You don't need to implement this function now, it is enough to use the `TODO`
  function instead of implementation as a temporary solution.
  We will implement this function during solving next tasks.

<div class="hint" title="Push me to see the signature of the applyBordersFilter function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun applyBordersFilter(picture: String): String
```
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Push me to see an example of the borders filter after completing the project">

An example of this filter:
<p>
    <img src="../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/almost.done/when_hint_1.png" alt="Filter example" width="200"/>
</p>

</div>

- _applySquaredFilter_, which has one string argument `picture`
  and returns a new picture with applied filter.
  You don't need to implement this function now, it is enough to use the `TODO`
  function instead of implementation as a temporary solution.
  We will implement this function during solving next tasks.

<div class="hint" title="Push me to see the signature of the applySquaredFilter function">

The signature of the function is:
```kotlin
fun applySquaredFilter(picture: String): String
```
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Push me to see an example of the squared filter after completing the project">

An example of this filter:
<p>
    <img src="../../utils/src/main/resources/images/part1/almost.done/when_hint_2.png" alt="Filter example" width="400"/>
</p>

</div>
