title: CSC Kotlin Course
language: English
summary: |-
  Hi everyone! This course is designed to introduce you to the Kotlin language. 
  It contains several modules on different areas of language learning. 
  To take this course, you should be familiar with the basic concepts of programming in any language, 
  such as variables, loops, conditional statements, etc. 
  Despite the fact that the first module contains an explanation of the basic concepts, 
  it rather introduces the Kotlin syntax for such constructs. 
  If you need more theoretical knowledge on any topic, you can get it here TODO:LINK by yourself.
  
  There are N modules in total. 
  Each module begins with a description of the concepts that will be explored in this module. 
  Each module consists of several projects - you can study the theory and implement the project 
  step by step, and then in the next project try to consolidate the knowledge gained and implement 
  a similar project by yourself. 
  Each project contains a gif animation illustrating the result that will be obtained at the end of 
  this tutorial. 
  You can start with any module, or even any project in each module, 
  as long as you are familiar with the concepts that precede that module or project.

  The first module of the course focuses on learning the basic concepts and implementing 
  six small console projects. 
  The second module will explore the concepts of object-oriented programming 
  and implement four web applications of popular board games. 
  It is worth noting that in the first module you implement projects completely independently 
  without pre-prepared code, however, starting from the second module, 
  part of the code was implemented by the course author so as not to dive into 
  the peculiarities of web development within this module. TODO: other modules
  
  If during the course you find errors or incorrect behaviour, you can report TODO
