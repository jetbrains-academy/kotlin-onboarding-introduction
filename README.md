# Introduction to Kotlin

This course is designed for novices in Kotlin
and focuses on the basic concepts of the Kotlin language.

Each lesson of the course is built in the form of a project:
step by step, by completing different small tasks,
you will get a finished small project in the end.
At the end of each lesson, an additional similar project will be offered:
it includes all the topics of the lesson but is not divided into small tasks.

Note, this course **does not provide the detailed explanation** of the basic concepts
like variables, if just offers to introduce you how to use it in Kotlin and can just remind the definitions.

All topics will be accompanied by links to [the official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html),
which you can read later.

**The covered topics:**
- the entry point for a Kotlin program;
- variables;
- functions;
- loops;
- ranges;
- `if` expressions;
- multi-row strings and string builder;
- basic facts about the null safety mechanism;
- basic facts about collections and lambda expressions.

After this course you will be ready to write basic console applications in the Kotlin-like style.
